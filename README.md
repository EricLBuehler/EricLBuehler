## Programming

- [Trc](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/trc)
  - A faster Arc: a Rust thread reference counted smart pointer.
  
### Programming Languages
- [Kestrel Programming Language](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/Kestrel-Programming-Language)
  - A compiled programming language built using Rust and that compiles to LLVM.
- [Falcon Programming Language](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/Falcon-Programming-Language)
  - An interpreted programming language built using C++ that is very similar to Python.
- [Merlin](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/merlin)

### Machine Learning
- [PerceiverIO Classifier](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/PerceiverIO-Classifier)
  - An MNIST classifier built using PerceiverIO.
- [The Neuron](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/The-Neuron)
  - A fully autonomous robot, with a detailed build guide.
- [CodingGPT](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/CodingGPT)
  - A GPT-like autoregressive, decoder-only transformer trained on data scraped from Reddit programming and science subreddits.

## Mathematics
- [Automatic Differentiation](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/Automatic-Differentiation-Custom)
  - My personal implementation of automatic differentiation, a method that powers ML and is used to calculate derivatives.
- [Proofling](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/Proofling)
  - An automatic proof checker. Just plug in truth statements, and it will check for inconsistencies
