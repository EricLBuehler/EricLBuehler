# Eric Buehler

### Libraries
- [Trc](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/trc)
  - A faster Arc: a Rust thread reference counted smart pointer.
  
### Programming Languages
- [Kestrel](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/kestrel)
  - Simple and safe - a statically and strongly typed programming language that compiles to LLVM.
- [Falcon Programming Language](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/Falcon-Programming-Language)
  - An interpreted programming language built using C++ that is very similar to Python.
- [Merlin](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/merlin)
  - A dynamically and strongly typed programming language built in Rust that does not have a GIL and unleashes the power of multithreading.

### Machine Learning Libraries
- [candle-vllm](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/candle-vllm)
  - Efficent platform for inference and serving local LLMs including an OpenAI compatible API server.
- [candle-lora](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/candle-lora)
  - LoRA implemented for the new [Candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) framework.

### Machine Learning Applications
- [PerceiverIO Classifier](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/PerceiverIO-Classifier)
  - An MNIST classifier built using PerceiverIO.
- [The Neuron](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/The-Neuron)
  - A fully autonomous robot, with a detailed build guide.
- [CodingGPT](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/CodingGPT)
  - A GPT-like autoregressive, decoder-only transformer trained on data scraped from Reddit programming and science subreddits.

## Mathematics
- [Automatic Differentiation](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/Automatic-Differentiation-Custom)
  - My personal implementation of automatic differentiation, a method that powers ML and is used to calculate derivatives.
- [Proofling](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/Proofling)
  - An automatic proof checker. Just plug in truth statements, and it will check for inconsistencies
